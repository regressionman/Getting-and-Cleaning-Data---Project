### UCI HAR Dataset Analysis
This repo contains an R script used to convert the UCI HAR Dataset to a tidy data set.

### UCI HAR Dataset

More information about the UCI HAR Dataset can be found at: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones]

### Requirements

Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


### R code
The R code that is used for analysis is contained within the run_analysis.R file.

### Tidy Dataset
The tidy dataset is contained within tidydata.txt

### CodeBook

The codebook available in this repo describes the variables, the data, the transformations performed on the dataset
